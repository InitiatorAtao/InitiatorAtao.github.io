<div class="problem">
<p>(Exercise 9.2.1) Show that the halting problem—the set of <span
class="math inline">\((M, w)\)</span> pairs such that <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> halts (with or without accepting) when
given input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>—is RE but not
recursive.</p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
<p>Use universal TM <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with input
<span class="math inline">\(\left( M,w \right)\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> halts, that equals to <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> halts. So <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> (with all states accepting) can
determine halting problem. The problem is RE.</p>
<p>For recursive we can reduce universal language problem to halting
problem by making all TMs reject by jumping into a infinity loop. Since
<span class="math inline">\(L_{u}\)</span> is not recursive, halting
problem is not recursive.</p>

<p>(Exercise 9.2.5) Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be

<div class="solution">
<p><span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> is non-RE because non-RE

<p>We know by Rice’s theorem that none of the following problems are
decidable. However, are they recursively enumerable or non-RE?</p>

<div class="solution">

<div class="problem">
<p>(Exercise 9.3.6 (b)) Show that the following question is decidable:
The set of codes for TMs that never make a move left on any input.</p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
<p>When a TM cannot move left, the input on the tape is only read once
from left to right just like DFA does. So after replacing the move left
transitions by transitions to a rejected state, the TM can be reduced to
a DFA. Then in DFA we can do searching like DFS or BFS to determine
whether the new rejected state (reached by move left transitions) in
<span class="math inline">\(O\left( n+m \right)\)</span> time, where
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the state number and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the transition number. All things
above can be done by a TM in limited steps, so the question is
decidable.</p>
