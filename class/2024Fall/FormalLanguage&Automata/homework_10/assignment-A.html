<div class="problem">
<p>(Exercise 8.2.3) Design a Turing machine that takes as input a number
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to it in binary. To be precise, the
tape initially contains a $ followed by <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in binary. The tape head is initially
scanning the $ in state <span class="math inline">\(q_{0}\)</span>. Your
TM should halt with <span class="math inline">\(N+1\)</span>, in binary,
on its tape, scanning the leftmost symbol of <span
class="math inline">\(N + 1\)</span>, in state <span
class="math inline">\(q_{f}\)</span>. You may destroy the $ in creating
<span class="math inline">\(N + 1\)</span>, if necessary. For instance,
<span class="math inline">\(q_{0}\$10011 \vdash^{*}
\$q_{f}10100\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(q_{0}\$11111
\vdash^{*} q_{f}100000\)</span>.</p>

<div class="problem">
<p>(Exercise 8.2.5 (b)) Consider the Turing machine <span

\{0,1,B\},
    \delta, q_{0}, B, \{q_{f}\} \bigr).\]</span> Informally but clearly
describe the language <span class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> consists of the following sets of
rules: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
{2}
    &amp; \delta(q_{0}, 0) &amp;&amp; = (q_{0}, B, R),\\
    &amp; \delta(q_{0}, 1) &amp;&amp; = (q_{1}, B, R),\\
    &amp; \delta(q_{1}, 1) &amp;&amp; = (q_{1}, B, R),\\
