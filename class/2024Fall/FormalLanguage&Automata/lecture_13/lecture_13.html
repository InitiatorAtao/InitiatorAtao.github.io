<h2 id="restrictions-of-tms">Restrictions of TMs</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Semi-infinite TMs: TMs which tape is only infinite in one
direction.</p>
<p>Can use 2-track with end-flag (to warn about tape edge) to simulate
normal TMs.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi stack TMs: TMs with no tape but at least 2 stacks.</p>
<p>Can use 2 stacks to simulate tape.</p></li>
<li><p>Counter Machines, CMs: TMs with no tape but counters
(non-negative integer that can be increase or decrease), where
transition is determined by the state, input symbol and which counters
are zero. 2-counter machines accepts all language in RE by:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Begin with 2-stack machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the stack symbols as <span
class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,r-1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Encode stack <span
class="math inline">\(X_1,\ldots,X_{n}\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}r^{i-1}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack pop equals to counter <span
class="math inline">\(i\rightarrow \left\lfloor
\frac{i}{r}\right\rfloor\)</span>. Stack push <span

<h2 id="simulate-computers-by-tms">Simulate computers by TMs</h2>
<p>Computers have things like:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Memory.</p></li>
<li><p>The program of the computer is stored in the memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Each instruction involves a limited number of words.</p></li>
<li><p>A typical computer has registers, which are memory words with
fast access.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To simulate computers by TMs, use a multitape TM with tapes refers to
Memory, Instruction Counter, Memory Address, etc. Then simulate
operations step by step on each tapes.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> computer operations, TMs
can simulate them in about <span class="math inline">\(O\left( n^3
\right)\)</span> time.</p>
<h2 id="the-busy-beaver-tms">The busy beaver TMs</h2>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-normal-state TM with a

<p><span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{BB}\left( 1
